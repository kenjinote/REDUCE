# This Makefile is a temporary solution.
#
# libreduce.a is a library for using REDUCE from C programs
# communicating via sockets. It is restricted to unix-like systems.
#
# Say "make", and you will find "libreduce.a" in the subdirectory
# corresponding to your architecture. In a subdir "examples" there you
# will find an executable "lrtest". There is currently no written
# documentation yet. Instead, have a look at "src/lrtest.c" and
# "src/reduce.h".
