This is a Qt-based worksheet GUI for Reduce UNDER DEVELOPMENT. For a
PREVIEW on Linux proceed as follows:

1. Get a matching PySide binary package following the instructions
   here: http://developer.qt.nokia.com/wiki/PySideDownloads/

2. Go to ../libreduce, and say "make". This will create there a new
   directory <dir> based on your exact machine and OS type.

3. Return here, and say "ln -s ../libreduce/<dir>/RedPy.so".

4. Say "./qreduce.py".

This also works on Mac OSX, but there you have to explicitly install
in addition Qt 4.7. Note that currently the program not at all ready
for production use.
