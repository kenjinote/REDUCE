.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a terminal-based interactive frontend for the
.Xr reduce 1
computer algebra system. It uses the
.Xr editline 3
library to provide editing facilities.
.Pp
This man page only covers
.Nm Ns Li .
For information on REDUCE find its documentation at
http://www.reduce-algebra.com.
.Pp
The executable REDUCE to be used by
.Nm
is compiled into the program. After proper installation you will find in
the
.Pa bin
directory of your REDUCE tree symbolic links
.Nm rfcsl
and/or
.Nm rfpsl
for your CSL-based and PSL-based REDUCE, respectively.
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl b
Black-and-white mode. That is, do not adjust any terminal colors.
.It Fl c Ar colorspec
The format of the
.Ar colorspec
string is adopted from the
.Ev LSCOLOR
environment variable of
.Xr ls 1 .
It is a concatenation of pairs of the format
.Ar f Ns Ar b ,
where
.Ar f
is the foreground color and
.Ar b
is the background color.
.Pp
The color designators are as follows:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width 4n -offset indent -compact
.It Sy a
black
.It Sy b
red
.It Sy c
green
.It Sy d
brown
.It Sy e
blue
.It Sy f
magenta
.It Sy g
cyan
.It Sy h
light grey
.It Sy A
bold black, usually shows up as dark grey
.It Sy B
bold red
.It Sy C
bold green
.It Sy D
bold brown, usually shows up as yellow
.It Sy E
bold blue
.It Sy F
bold magenta
.It Sy G
bold cyan
.It Sy H
bold light grey; looks like bright white
.It Sy x
default foreground or background
.El
.Pp
Note that the above are standard
\*[Ai]
colors.
The actual display may differ
depending on the color capabilities of the terminal in use.
.Pp
The order of the attributes are as follows:
.Pp
.Bl -enum -offset indent -compact
.It
.Nm
output,
.It
.Xr reduce 1
output that is not typeset as a mathematical formula,
.It
.Xr reduce 1
prompts,
.It
input lines,
.It
.Xr reduce 1
output that is typeset as a mathematical formula. As a rule these are
the evaluation results in the algebraic mode,
.It
debugging output, which appears only when
.Nm
is configured and compiled for debugging.
.El
.Pp
Except for the debugging output color the chosen order of the colors is as they
appear on the screen when starting
.Nm .
.Pp
The default is
.Qq "fxxxbxbxexgx" ,
i.e. magenta
.Nm
output, general
.Xr reduce 1
output in the terminal foreground color, red prompts, red input lines,
blue mathematical output, and cyan debugging messages, where the
background is generally the default terminal background.
.It Fl h
Print a help message
.It Oo Fl m Oc Ar bytes Oo kKmM Oc
[PSL-based REDUCE only] Specify the number of bytes used for the Lisp
heap. Case insensitive k ("kilo") is expanded to 000, and m ("mega") is
expanded to 000000.
.Pp
On PSL based 64 bit systems, heap sizes less than one million are
multiplied on the REDUCE side by one million. This happens after the
expansion of k and m. For instance, 1 = 1m yields 1 MB, and 1k yields
1000 MB. Consequently, k denotes GB until 1000k, which is again 1 MB. At
present, this mechanism should be used in order to avoid a possible
integer overflow in the heap size argument to the underlying binary PSL.
.Pp
For historical reasons, it is also possible to drop the
.Fl m
passing the heap size as a command instead of as an option. This variant
is deprecated and likely to be removed in the future.
.It Fl u
Automatically load the
.Xr reduce 1
package
.Qq utf8
at startup. This uses unicode characters for the mathematical output.
Note that the use of
.Fl u
requires a UTF-8-capable terminal, which is not checked by
.Nm .
.It Fl v | V
Print a more verbose banner message. In addition, print information when
updating the internal database of known packages, modules, and switches
(see Section on TAB Completion below).
.It Fl -
A command line argument of "--" marks the end of option arguments. Any
arguments following this are directly passed to the REDUCE program
spawned by
.Nm ,
in addition and after those generated by
.Nm .
For this sake, we consider the memory specification an option also when
not using the
.Fl m
format.
.El
.Sh "KEY BINDINGS"
The
.Xr editline 3
command line_help, which is bound to the function key F2 by default,
displays all current bindings of key sequences to
.Xr editline 3
commands.
.Sh "TAB COMPLETION"
The string "load_" is completed to "load_package." After "load_package"
Reduce package names are completed. Reduce packages in this sense are
exactly those listed in trunk/packages/package.map.
.Nm rfpsl
completes these package names also after all other load commands besides
"load_package".
.Nm rfcsl,
in contrast, completes after any load command other than "load_package"
loadable modules, which establish a quite comprehensive superset of the
Reduce packages.
.Pp
After double quotes there are filenames completed with respect to the
directory that
.Nm redfront
has been started in.
.Pp
After "on" and "off" there are switch names completed. To cover also
switches that become available during a session via explicit declaration
or loading or reading packages or modules, the database of
.Nm redfront
can be explicitly updated via the
.Xr editline 3
command line_learn_completion, which is bound to ESC-Z by default. With
the
.Fl V | v
option there is some information printend when updating.
.Sh "IMPLEMENTATION NOTES"
For redfront 1 KB is 1000 Bytes in contrast to 1024 Bytes, 1 MB is 1000
KB, and so on.
.Pp
PSL based REDUCE on 32 bit systems generally does not admit more than
128m heap size. On some systems (e.g. Mac G4, Solaris) this even reduces
to 64m. On some architectures the command and the
.Fl m
option are generally ignored on the REDUCE side. The heap is then set to
the maximum possible size.
.Sh "FILES"
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Pa $HOME/.reduce_history
stores command history between sessions.
.It Pa $PWD/.editrc , Pa $HOME/.editrc
are
.Xr editline 3
configuration files, in which global settings as well as particular
settings for
.Nm
can be made. See
.Xr editrc 5
for details. At startup
.Nm
sources the first one of these that exists.
.El
.Sh "SEE ALSO"
.Xr editline 3
.Sh EXAMPLES
The following starts
.Nm
for PSL-based
.Xr reduce 1
via the corresponding symbolic link with unicode support and 1 GB heap
on a 64 bit architecture:
.Pp
.Dl "rfpsl -u -m 1k"
.Sh HISTORY
The first version of
.Nm
was derived from an
.Xr X 7
interface by C. Cannam and W. Neun. Earlier versions have been realized
and distributed by W. Neun and by A. Dolzmann and T. Sturm starting in
1999.
.Sh "AUTHORS"
.An T. Sturm
.Aq sturm@redlog.eu
.Sh "BUGS"
Due to limitations of
.Xr editline 3
the prompt coloring does not work. The prompt generally receives the
same color as the input.
.Pp
The builtin
.Xr editline 3
command line_help (bound to F2) for displaying all current key bindings
appears to have some problems with correctly printing key sequences.
.Pp
The choice of background colors with
.Fl c
is not implemented yet. Nevertheless, choices must be specified in the
.Ar colorspec
argument, which are generally treated like
.Qq x
at present.
.Pp
The PSL heapsize selection policy for 64 bit architectures in contrast
to 32 bit architectures (necessary to avoid some integer overflows on
the former) is unintuitive and should probably be hidden via redfront.
