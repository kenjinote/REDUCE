I am a bit worried that some file-names here were truncated to 8+3 and
SOMETIMES that seems not to matter to PSL but sometimes it does. I have put
a everything back to full-length form (eg datamachine.b) but somebody else who
understands PSL better may like to review whether this was the right thing to
do! My GUESS is that the short names were a relic from times when Windows
has limits of filename lengths?

The one thing I have left (as an oddity) is auto-tr.b AND autoload-tr.b, where
the 8+3 truncation introduced a name-clash.

I do not know what the file "hugo" is for but it lists the short names not
the full ones.
