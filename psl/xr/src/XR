!  Note that on many systems XR will
!   run perfectly well without this
!    file being available; you may

! Paths of Reduce executables.  If your system is odd, you may need to
! change them.  Most people should find they're set correctly in the
! distribution.  Note that the values in the XR.orig distribution file
! aren't meaningful filenames; they're codes solely for the Install.sh
! script to change.
