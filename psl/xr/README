        XR Development Version -- ZIB Berlin, 1992 - 1993
        =================================================


XR is a program which interacts with the normal REDUCE package to
provide a keyboard-and-mouse operated graphical user interface under
UNIX and the X windowing system.  It requires the presence of REDUCE,
and X11 Release 4 or 5 with the Athena Widget Set.

This distribution contains the sources and an executable image for the
specific platform.  Please read the supplied printed documentation or
the file ./doc/xr.tex (also in compressed PostScript form as xr.ps.Z)
for installation and operation instructions.

If you have any problems, please do not hesitate to get in touch with
us; the electronic mail address to use is that of Herbert Melenk,
