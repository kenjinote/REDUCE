Status report January 2011
==========================

PSL
---

We have the PSL sources in the trunk cleaned up for the most 
wanted versions, i.e. Windows, Linux(Intel), and Mac/OS (Intel)
both 32 and 64 bit.

The maintenance for the PSL trees is done by the script

make-psl.sh     in this directory.

This script chooses the traditional PSL-name from the generic name used
at configure time, e.g.

x86_64-unknown-ubuntu10.04   ==>  AMD64

which keeps the name stable across changes of the OS version or
change of the Linux distribution.

Simply starting the script by ./make-psl.sh produces a PSL tree *here*,
most important are ./bin and ./dist .

There are variants (as usual :-) ) which allow one to produce a different
version on a compatible system, e.g. an extended AMD64 system (using
all registers, inline cons, etc) which can be made by

./make-psl.sh AMD64_ext

on an 64 bit Linux system. As of today, you can produce versions called
linux (32 bit Intel Linux) or brock (don't ask) by setting the parameter.

Similar thing can be done on MAC/OS. The canonical name is mactintel64,
but macintel can be generated on a 64 bit system as well.


REDUCE from PSL
---------------

Based on the PSL versions described above, one is able to produce REDUCE
versions for PSL which not rely on binaries from ZIB Berlin. After 

svn update               (or checkout)    and
./configure --with-psl         one can use
cd psl 
./make-psl.sh            not stricly necessary, but we cannot discuss this here
./make-reduce.sh         takes the local binaries and the Makefile form configure
                         to produce a REDUCE version. The names are the same as above,
                         Parameterisation as above too, a little trick is used to
                         find the Makefile.             
                         REDUCE can be started from ../pslbuild/<MACHINE>/redpsl
                         which can be copied to a more convenient place.


PSL/ REDUCE maintenance 
-----------------------

If one wants to refresh REDUCE without installing all PSL stuff which is unchanged,
simply use

svn update
./make.sh                again same parametrisation. This script basically finds 
                         the way to ../pslbuild/<MACHINE> and starts make



Status report March 2009
========================

This file contains a collection of little directories with names such as
psl-win32 etc. Each basically contains a file "xport,pat". The directory
"support-packages" contains a utility "xport" that can process this and that
fetches a set of PSL binaries from a web-site as specified in xport.pat.

The PSL build scripts arrange to compile xport and use it in such a way that
the PSL binaries relevant to you computer get fetched and placed within
the pslbuild subdirectory at the top level here.

All this arrangement is because we do not yet have the PSL sources in a tidy
state for release - and that includes getting them in a state where the
associated build-scripts are all easy to use and everything has been at
least reasonably checked. It is hoped that in a while there will be a PSL
source release, but at present this is not generally available. But the
current arrangements should allow the PSL version of Reduce to be built
and used.
