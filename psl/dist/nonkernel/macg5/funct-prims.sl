% 27-Mar-84 13:56:06 (Jim Ambras/CRC)
%  Changed use of idloc to id2int.  Added compiletime load of sys-consts.

%  Changed three *WTimes2 expressions for (WConst 6) to adds because *WTimes2
%  is no longer a cmacro.

%  Changed expressions (displacement (reg 1) 0) to (indirect (reg 1)) to   
%  improve code generation.
