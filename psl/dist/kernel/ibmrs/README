 Dear REDUCE / PSL customer,



the IBM RS/6000 version of Reduce or PSL we sent out to you is defective
under certain circumstances.

Problems occur on the RS/6000-550 mostly causing an illegal instruction
trap of the hardware. 

Please find enclosed a diskette with the fixed software.
The diskette is undumped to a temporary storage by 


tar -xf /dev/rfd0
uncompress *.Z
chmod +x bpsl


Four files are undumped from diskette, namely

bpsl , pslcomp.img and bpsheap.c plus this README file

If you did not order "full PSL", please delete pslcomp.img and bpsheap.c.
In order to fix REDUCE, please 

move the file bpsl to $reduce/psl and run
$reduce/util/mkreduce


for PSL (using PSL naming conventions), please move bpsl to $pxk,
pslcomp.img to $psys and bpsheap.c to $pxk . After that, please do

cd $psl 
make

Both Reduce and PSL should work properly now.
We regret the inconvenience and problems you encountered using the software.


PLEASE NOTE for a change to AIX 3.2
-----------------------------------

We did not yet upgrade our AIX system, but we got hints that the binary files
in $pxk/syscall (or $reduce/psl/syscall) have to be recompiled under the new
OS level prior to using PSL or Reduce. You can do that by


cd $reduce/psl/syscall    # or cd $pk/ibmrs/syscall
./install


After recompilation you can use the kernel extension as usual.

In case of problems please send email to:  neun@sc.ZIB-Berlin.de
