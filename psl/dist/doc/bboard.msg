                      PSL Version 3.4 Available

We have just installed the latest version of Utah's PSL (Portable
Standard LISP) system. This system is written almost entirely in
itself, and is compiled with an efficient optimizing LISP compiler,
with machine oriented extensions (called "SYSLISP"). The LISP itself
is based on Utah Standard LISP, with modernizations and extensions
derived from FranzLISP, Common-LISP, etc.  PSL currently runs on
VAX under UNIX, VAX under VMS, Cray-1, IBM 370, Gould BSD, and a number
of Motorola MC680?0 systems (Suns, Apollo, HP 9000, Iris, MacIntosh Plus).

To use the system please put a line

	source ~psl/dist/psl-names

in your .cshrc file.

A printed copy of the PSL manual can be obtained from [........];
there is also a complete online version of this manual, organized as a
set of files, one per chapter. These are stored as
$plpt/nnnn-chaptername.  PLEASE DO NOT print your own copy.

To get started, read $psl/psl-intro.

The licence agreement under which we have recieved this version of PSL
restricts it to our internal use. Please do not distribute the code
(source or listings), or documentation outside of our group.

If there are any problems, please report them to [.....].
