   ***** Important Notice ******


The installation of PSL 3.4 requires that
a systemcall is added to the AIX operating
system. PSL 3.4 cannot run otherwise.

The installation of the systemcall requires
super user privilege.

The systemcall can be installed easily by running
the installation procedure as described in the
NOTES ON USING THE IBM RS/6000 PSL FILE TREE

cd ./dist/kernel/ibmrs/syscall
./installsysc

The directory ./dist/kernel/ibmrs/syscall 

contains the sources of the program installsysc.

It is recommendable to add the call to

cd ./dist/kernel/ibmrs/syscall ; ./installsysc 

to the AIX boot files.
