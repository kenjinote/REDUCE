This version of SoftFP-3a has just the same main code as the original
(and a copy of the original distribution archive is present in an adjacent
directory). But it has been changes so as to use autoconf and automake to
cope with customisation for differing targets. This may leave it less
well optimised in some cases, but reduces need for manual selection of
which target it is to be used with.
