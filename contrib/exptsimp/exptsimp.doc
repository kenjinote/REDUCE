This  short  note describes  a  new  REDUCE operator  that  tries  to
simplify expressions  that contain exponentials and  surds.  It  does
this by applying algebraic relations between these.
The operator is `EXPTSIMP'. Usage is

EXPTSIMP(EXP:exprn):exprn

The result is an equivalent expression.
Method.   The  basic idea  is to  replace every  surd or  exponential
by  a variable  and  add a  equations defining  the  variable.    For

the  resulting  polynomial  system is  the  Groebner  basis  is  then
calculated, and the surds and exponentials are substituted  back into
the result, leading  to a possibly simpler  expression.  Due to  this
method, no assumptions about a specific choice of branches  are made,
with the exception that  multiple occurences of the same surd  always
denote the same branch.
