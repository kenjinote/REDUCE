The files in this "contrib" directory may be historical, or incomplete
or work-in-progress or so small and sp[ecialised that they do not
(yet?) deserve to become part of the full system. But they may be
useful starting points for somebody, and in some cases they may get
revived or completed. We will accept code or code fragments to put here
with much less fuss and almost not testing, while packages to go in the
main body at least need to build and have some sort of test case that
works most of the time.
