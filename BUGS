                                   BUGS


This is a place where I can record bugs and the like as I spot them. I HOPE
that as they get resolved I will either remove them from the list here or
write comments about the fixes. But reality suggests that that will not
always happen!  I will put a "**" in front of ones I believe are fixed.

To start with these are mainly going to be not just CSL-specific but
issues within CSL itself. Some cleverer way to organise bugs than a simple
text file is probably called for.

**25 May 2008 (CSL)
   On Windows (at least I tested on Vista-64 but with a 32-bit build)
   launch csl or fwindemo (etc) then try the Font/Font menu. When the
   application is compiled normally that works as expected. But when
   both FOX and the application are compiled with debugging options
   it appears to loop.
   29 May: --enable-debug but -O0 for the compilation of FOX makes it behave
   OK again. Some time I will need to compile the files that make up FOX one
   by one with -O1 and see which one leads to that change. Meanwhile
   adjustments to Xft font support lead to the X11 version responding to
   the FONT menu by only showing the Computer Modern family of fonts
   available, and that is a bit of a disaster since none of those are
   fixed pitch.
   31 May: Font/Font better on Windows, but on Linux it does not display
   the current font as its default selection in the expected manner.
   2 June: changes to FXTerminal and FXFontSelector fix that.

**25 May 2008 (CSL)
   The "^T" keystroke exchanges the characters, but in the windowed
   interfaces the flipped ones are redrawn in black not the normal
   red input colour. The input line gets redrawn when some other character
   is entered.  27 May: this was true for a range of other editing directives
   and may now be fixed by using eg replaceStyledText where I used to use
   just replaceText in FXTerminal.cpp

**25 May 2008 (CSL)
   The "^L" keystroke clears the screen, but typing a character afterwards
   led to a "bad argument to changeStyle" diagnostic because I had not
   reset promptEnd. Should now be fixed, but ought I to re-insert the current
   prompt on clearing the screen?

**26 May 2008 (CSL)
   termdemo on Linux behaves OK, but "fwindemo -w" or fwindemo without
   DISPLAY set seems to fail to use colours and fails to accept control
   keys when I tested it from an xterm using remote access. 28 May fixed - the
   build within FOX had not detected (n)curses etc properly.

**26 May 2008 (CSL)
   "fontdemo cmmi10" behaved OK from a remote xterm (but PERHAPS the font was
   present on the x-term?) but showmathdemo crashed with a segmentation fault!
   Ditto when run native. 31 May: Rework of the use of Xft etc fixes this.

05 June 2008 (CSL, ?PSL)
   Redlog does not run its test programs, so I have commented it out from the
   list of things to test!

09 July 2008 (CSL)
   Xft/fontconfig startup on MacOS can be VERY slow at least the first time,
   to the extent that it seems that the programs have just got stuck. At
   present by belief is that this is merely (!) that it can take minutes
   of CPU time to set up the fontconfig caches by inspecting all the fonts.

09 July 2008 (CSL)
   Windows64 (via mingw64) behaves sort of OK for CSL, but fontdemo and
   showmathdemo just display an empty frame. Hmmm.

09 July 2008 (PSL)
   The sets of pre-build PSL "bpsl" etc files need review by somebody who
   understands them, and the scripts/pslver.sh script reviewed so it picks
   the right one. I am uncertain about the "-td" parameter value that will
   be best, and the way that the varies between 32 and 64-bit models.

09 July 2008 (CSL, PSL)
   A scheme to re-build individual packages (and to collect relevant
   dependency information) is needed.

09 July 2008 (PSL)
   The build-sequence needs integrating into Makefile.am and it then needs
   dependency information so it will be re-done in relevant situations. Also
   the destination for all the log files needs to be reviewed.

09 July 2008 (CSL, PSL)
   Perhaps a scheme to run individual tests is needed.


09 July 2008 (PSL)
   The win32/bpsl.exe is a hacked one that uses static allocation and hence
   survives Vista-64, but it is probably inflexible when that trick is not
   necessary

09 July 2008 (PSL)
   script to launch REDUCE needed to go in "bin" directory

09 July 2008 (PSL)
   On Windows, how should I select between bpsl.exe and bpslw.exe? In
   general if people want to use redfront or emacs how can that be done?

09 July 2008 (redfront)
   Needs altering from GNU readline to the BSD-licensed "libedit"
   (see http://sourceforge.net/projects/libedit (probably defunt) and
   http://www.thrysoee.dk/editline/ which is an autoconfed variant
   on what you find at
   cvsweb.netbsd.org/bsdweb.cgi/src/lib/libedit/?sortby=date#dirlist).
   This aims for total compatibility with GNU readline but with a license
   that makes redistribution of binaries less complicated and that will
   hence fit with this project better.

09 July 2008 (PSL)
   A quick test seemed to show that the amd64 build on Linux took a LOT
   longer than the linux(32) build on the same machine. Why? Is this to do
   with how much memory was allocated?

09 July 2008 (CSL)
   Should I put "images" as directories so that "make" can observe
   date-stamps on individual fasl files directly and easily?

24 July 2008 (CSL)
   Much broken while I am in the middle of changing so that image files can
   be replaced by image directories!

24 July 2008 (CSL)
   The build "--with-cygwin" appears not to link at present. Not making
   investigation an especially high priority.


25 July 2008 (PSL mostly I think)
   support/remake.red and PERHAPS other places express views about where
   files live, as in "$reduce/lisp/psl/$MACHINE/red/" in update!-fasl2
   and maybe other places. This does not match the new file layout and is
   a bit delicate anyway.
