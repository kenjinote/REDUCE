# This is at least an approximation to a script that will ensure that
# an installation of Scientific Linux has evough development tools and
# libraries installed to make the rebuilding of Reduce possible.

# It was created by taking the corresponding Fedora script and expanding
# the group installs and expanding each to install all the packages that
# Fedora would have, initially assuming that package names would be the
# same.
