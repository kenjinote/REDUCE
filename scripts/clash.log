This is the output from the script clash.sh. The script runs using the
CSL "bootstrapreduce" and attempts to identify cases where several modules
in Reduce define functions whose names match. This can have arisen for
several reasons:

(1) Accidental use of the same name for functions not intended to be
    particularly related. This could cause trouble if the two packages
    were to be loaded at the same time, so (at least) one variant should be
    renamed.
(2) Some function that might ideally be in the core was implemented in one
    package and another package copied the definition. In some cases one but
    not all versions have been changed or upgraded and there is risk of
    inconsistency or at least confusion. The function should be lifted so its
    capabilities are generally available.
(3) As (2) but the two versions were developed independenly and may not be
    identical. A merge step is needed before making the code cenrally
    available or sometimes the differences in implementation will be so
    great that at least in the short term renaming will be the only feasible
    way to resolve the clash.
(3) A package-writer found a correction or upgrade to the core but at the
    time they did not have confidence or authority to install their version
    centrally, so they put a redefinition just in their own package. The
    changes should be properly globally tested and merged back to the main
    version.
(4) A package writer wanted extra or different behaviour from some generally
    used function so chose just to replace the main code with their own.
    A bad effect of this is that merely loading the package concerned would
    alter system behaviour for everybody. My belief is that wherever possible
    the new behaviour should be retrofitted to the central code, and if the
    change is dramatic and could have severe performance issues if left in
    place always the origial should become something like
       symbolic procedure trunk_function u;
         if !*package_maud_active then maud_function u
         else original_function u;
       symbolic procedure original_function u;
         .. code as it should be in the default case ...
(5) In a few cases a preliminary version of some function is present in
    part of the code used very early in the bootstrapping process and then
    a definitive copy is installed later. The early version may thus only
    be used for a fairly short time during bootstrapping and having it
    simpler than the final version may help. Such cases might be viewed
    as features rather than as problems!


There are MANY clashes here between fmprint and tmprint because one of these
is merely an adjusted version of the other. But this history means that as
changes are made to one those fixes will often not be applied to the other. I
have hande-edited this list to segragate those cases since I count them as
a special case.

There are also clashes of behaviour that can be caused by use of "copyd"
in packages, especially if those happen when the relevant package is merely
loaded. Such behaviour would preclude for ever uprating that package so it
became part of the pre-loaded core to give everybody instant optimised access
to it without any delay that autoloading involves. I rather believe that
treatment as suggested for (4) above would make things cleaner in that
situatiuon, in that the variable !*package_maud_active could then be set on
or off easily.
