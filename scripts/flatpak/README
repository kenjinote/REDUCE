The purpose here is to make REDUCE available as a flatpak application.

flatpak must be installed on your system. Some linux distributions come already with it - on others one needs to find a repository and install it from there.  

The script 'mk-reduce-flatpakbundle.sh' generates a flatpak bundle called 'reduce.flatpak' for REDUCE.

To deploy the bundle simply execute the command

flatpak install reduce.flatpak

Now you are ready to run various flavors of REDUCE. To run redcsl, for example, one would say 

flatpak --command=redcsl run de.camusings.Reduce

Besides redcsl also rfcsl, bootstrapreduce, redpsl and rfpsl are provided.

The sandbox permissions are set in de.camusings.Reduce.json to allow for restricted access to the host filessystems (in the "finish-args" section). If other permissions are wanted they need to be set there (see docs.flatpak.org/en/latest/sandbox-permissions.html).
