\chapter*{Acknowledgment}

The production of this version of the manual has been the result of the
contributions of a large number of individuals who have taken the time and
effort to suggest improvements to previous versions, and to draft new
sections.  Particular thanks are due to Gerry Rayna, who provided a draft
rewrite of most of the first half of the manual.  Other people who have
made significant contributions have included John Fitch, Martin Griss,
Stan Kameny, Jed Marti, Herbert Melenk, Don Morrison, Arthur Norman,
Eberhard Schr\"ufer, Larry Seward and Walter Tietze.  Finally, Richard
Hitt produced a {\TeX} version of the {\REDUCE} 3.3 manual, which has been
a useful guide for the production of the {\LaTeX} version of this manual.
