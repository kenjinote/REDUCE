This is a branch of "cslbase" but it intended to provide a kit from which
a CSL version of Reduce can be made with the least possible complication
and with the least reasonable reliance on system support. It assumes that
the generated files u01.c to u12.c and reduce.img have already been created
using a full version of the system (so it includes ready-built copies here).
It does not provide a GUI or any other clevers. It is expected that it JUST
needs a bunch of files of C code to be compiled and linked together. You
should not expect "help" capability etc, but the ALGEBRA bits of Reduce
should work the way they always have.

All custmisations here should be guarded by "#if(n)def EMBEDDED". And the
*.h and *.c files that are in this directory should eventually be
exectly the same as the ones in cslbase. Just this set has a ready-build
reduce.img file, a set of u01,c to u12.c, and its own private and very
simple Makefile

This version has now fallen behind and is out of date with respect to the
main set of files, so I need to merge in changes soon!

Files brought up to date and a Makefile.x64 provided that works (for me)
using the cgywin-hosted version of mingw64. Note that these days the single
image file (reduce.img) should work whether the code is built in 32 or
64-bit mode.

Basically I now suggest you look at the new-embedded directory rather than
this one. I will keep this here for a while, but be aware that it will
be deleted in due course...
