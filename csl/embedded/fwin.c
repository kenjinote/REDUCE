 *
 *    $xxx   (terminated by '.', '/' or '\' with at least one char x)

 *           next inspect the environment variable xxx and dump its
 *           value into the output.  If the variable is unset then a check
 *           is made for the value of a global lisp variable called $xxx,
 *           and if that exists and is a string or symbol it is used.
 *           If $xxx is undefined a null string is inserted.
 *           If one of the variables is defined but has an improper value
 *           then the whole file-translation fails.
 *           The use of two Lisp variables makes it possible to control
 *           precedence between these and shell variables.
 *           At one stage I make the search order $xxx, env, @xxx, but then
 *           in shell scripts it is easier to go "-D@xxx=..." because
 *           "-D$xxx=..." tends to get subject to shell expansion. So now
 *           I give priority to the version I use most, to avoid being bitten
 *           when somebody has a stray shell variable set.
 *
 *    ~      ) followed by '.', '/' or '\'
 *    ~xxx   )
 *           On Unix these try to find home directories using

 *           If that fails ~ expands into nothing at all.
 *           This syntax is only recognised at the very start of a file-name.
 *           For systems other than Unix this syntax will not be useful and
 *           should be avoided, however as an experimental place-holder I
 *           may do things with environment variables called HOME etc.
 * 
 * 
 * I convert file-names of the form aaa/bbb/ccc.ddd into something
 * acceptable to the system being used, even though this may result in
 * some native file titles that include '/' characters becoming unavailable.
 * The reasoning here is that scripts and programs can then use Unix-like

 * 100 years ahead, and I intend not to worry. Note it is important here to
 * us an unsigned number or else the overflow is sooner and might even cause
 * genuine pain!
 *
 * ANOTHER NOTE: I only allow the "seconds" field to run from 0 to 59.
 * In consequence I am quite possibly going to mess up when there are
 * leap seconds, and this confusion could make times processed here
 * disagree across systems by up to the number of leap seconds that
 * have been used to date. Well I have quite severe doubts about time
 * agreement closer than a few seconds anyway and so again I am going to
 * ignore this oddity! But those who keep systems synchronised at a
