/*
 * This was ONCE a place where all system-specific options were detected
 * and mapped onto tidy macros that could guide subsequent compilation. Now
 * all that is handled in "config.h", which is manufactured on a per-target
 * basis by a configure-script created by autoconf.
 *
 * Now it us used for just a few tests based on what comes out of
 * config.h to set up really major further bits of configuration, where
 * the characteristic of what is done here is that it will vary from
 * target to target and it is truly pervasive in consequences.
