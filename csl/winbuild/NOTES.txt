Notes - March 2014
==================

At present this script is just set up to build under the 32-bit cygwin
installed on either a 32 or 64-bit version of Windows. On a 32-bit windows
it will only build 32-bit executables.

It expects 64-bit cygwin to have been installed in c:\cygwin64 or d:\cygwin64
and manages to use that for building the 64-bit cygwin version of Reduce.

Some of this limitation and the curiosity of using cygwin64 as well as
because when I first started looking into this scheme the 64-bit cygwin was
sufficiently new that some of the packages associated with it were unstable
and it was not possible to build native windows or 32-bit cygwin applications
under it for lack of some of the development libraries that I needed. These
issues have probably now been resolved and so I suspect I can change things
here so that my build can be conducted under either 32-bit or 64-bit cygwin
equally well.

But before I make that an official statement it will be necessary to
test both versions. Until I am confident that the fat binaries I introduce
here are a really good idea time spent doing that will not count as
a high priority - but I might encourage others to try adapting the
scripts here to try it out!

I suggest first checking how well cygwin64 binaries can be (cross-)built
under 32-bit cygwin and vice versa, and then adapting the scripts here to
build based on just one version of cygwin.
