Log of a fresh try.

Install Solaris 10u7 (x86) with default options. I start it up with the
Sun Java Desktop, and give myself a 16Gb disc.

Start Firefox and browse to www.blastware.org. Fetch pkgutil_i386.pkg and
go pkgadd -d *.pkg to install it.

pkgutil -U to update list.  pkgutil -a > pkgs to list them. Now I can grep in
pkgs to find what I need.

pkgutil -i CSWsudo so that when I make a user I can use sudo to adminster
things.

Now install CSWsvn (so I can fetch Reduce etc). This fetches a load of
things that are prerequisites!

CSWossh for ssh etc
CSWpkgconfig
CSWlibx11dev
CSWlibxcbdev
CSWautomake
CSWautoconf
CSWvim
CSWgmake
CSWgcc3g++  (reported that postinstall script for gcc3core failed to
             run properly)
Try gcc3g++ again. A web search suggests that the bug is a long-standing
mess up in the packaging and should not actually hurt!
CSWbison
CSWflex
CSWbzip2
CSWgsed

Now I create a user and arrange that it has a .bashrc and .bash_profile that
set PATH to /opt/ccs/bin:/usr/ucb/bin:/usr/swf/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:
/sbin:/opt/csw/bin

I can then use subversion to fetch the Reduce files.

When I try scripts/csl-sanity-check.sh all goes OK until I get a load
of moans re _X_SENTINEL in the file /opt/csw/include/X11/Xlib.h

Web searches find other people having pain of similar styles on a variety
of platforms, but I have not found a totally authoritative-looking
explanation. So I put
   #define _X_SENTINEL(n)
in towards the top of Xlib.h and that allows things to compile!
