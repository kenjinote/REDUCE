January 2011

Well this file has not been being kept very well up to date!

Major developments over the last year:

(1) PSL sources and the ability to rebuild PSL from them are now almost
all in place.

(2) CSL is in the process of migrating from use of the FOX GUI toolkit to
use of wxWidgets. Volunteers of help with bug-finding, getting the user
interface "right", checking how things behave on various platforms and in
various locales etc would be welcome.


March 2007: creation of a "relink.sh" script.
2006: This program is now (mostly) set up using "configure"
