 * To the extent that (a) it is convenient and (b) that I have completed
 * development of this code, the behaviour of the Windowed interface in
 * FXTerminal.cpp and of the console mode one in termed.c are compatible.
 * The key-bindings are intended to be "emacs-like" so they support command
 * to move backwards and forwards by characters and words, to delete
 * characters or words, to adjust case and to scan up and down through a
 * history. More elaborate variants on this idea would permit the user to
 * re-assign key-bindings. I have not implemented that at all. Partly to
 * try to keep my code simple and partly because I feel customised key-
 * bindings are a source of terrible confusion.
 *
 * Because of my intended use for this code I have allocated some keys to
 * menu shortcuts that will not be relevant to other people but that are
 * useful to me. NOt all keys can and not all keys do work under both
 * FXTerminal and termed environments. I annotate this key-list with a
 * ($) for things not active under FXTerminal and with (!) for not active
 * or incomplete under termed.
 *

 *
 *                         KEYBOARD HANDLING
 *
 *
 * Key-bindings that I hope to make work in both terminal and windowed mode,
 * on both Unix/Linux, Microsoft Windows and the Macintosh.
 * 
 * Note that ALT can be achieved either by holding the ALT key at the
 * same time as the listed key, or by pressing ESC before the key.
 * 
 * ALT takes priority over SHIFT, and Control takes priority over ALT so
 * that a character is only treated as having one attribute. If it has none
 * it just inserts itself.
 * 
 * Where I put a "-" in this table it means that I do not define the meaning
 * of the keystroke. In the short term at least that will either cause the
 * keystroke to be ignored, inserted, or treated the same way as the
 * corresponding character without Control or ALT. In the longer term I may
 * assign behaviours to some of those keys. I also want to reserve the
 * possibility of making keys with both Control and ALT have yet different
 * effects.
