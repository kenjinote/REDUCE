The files here are fore use with wxshowmath.
During at least initial development of the code there it will
support a very simple textual format that specified where to place
characters on the page. Data in this format can be created and edited
by hand but also the code in contrib/boxdisplay may move towards
generating it in a systematic way.

While this level of preliminary testing is going on the file here
can represent test cases. They may each have originally had some
specific purpose but that will not be documented!

Good luck and enjoy.

Use via something like
   ./wxshowmath path/to/cslbase/wxdata/parens.dat
