Note:
  This file and any script called "relink.sh" must be viewed as seriously
out of date. If you want to rebuild the code here you should use "configure"
and recompile everything from source. However the historical comments about
old Linux versions might sometimes give useful clues in cases where you have
trouble, so I am not instantly deleting this!

                   RELINKING REDUCE ON VARIOUS PLATFORMS



If you are going to relink REDUCE you must have gcc, g++ and a fairly full
set of development libraries installed on your system. That must include
not just the basic C and C++ libraries but support for developent of
X-windows applications, including Xcursor, freetype, Xft. If you get
linker errors in most cases it will be because your Linux does not have some
required development-support packages installed.

The notes her relate to my "relink.sh" scripts and the level of problems and
success I have experienced building on one varient of Linux and relinking
on another. The exact experience can depend critically on exactly which
packages are installed on both the development and the relinking system.

In all cases it makes sense to do an online update to get all software
fully patched before trying anything. With that caveat, and subject to
having enough development libraries installed (Xft, Xcursor and (n)curses
being notable as things where the development environments needed for
relinking code using them may easily be overlooked) I believe I find
broad compatibility across a range of Linux distributions released since
2003 (specifcally from Red Hat 9 onwards)


Red Hat 6.2, 7.2
    I now view these as out of date, and so I expect that you need to
compile your own system completely on one of them if you need to run
there.

Red Hat 8.0
    If code has been compiled on Red Hat 8.0 my link script will try to
link in -lXft2. For re-linking on more modern systems this needs to be
changed to link in just -lXft. If you try to link newer object files on
Red Hat 8.0 you should expect to need to find and install Xcursor and
fontconfig libraries.

Ubuntu 6.10 
    Object file screated on Ubuntu tend to reference __stack_check_fail
since by default the compiler options there enable stack checking. Most
other current Linux variante will not provide support for this.
To link on Ubuntu I needed to install curses-devel and Xcursor-devel.


Debian 3.1
    To be able to re-link Reduce I needed to install the Xcursor-devel
package.

SuSE 10.1
    SuSE provides an ncurses library but not curses, so I needed to change
some linker scripts to say -lncurses where they previously said -lcurses.
