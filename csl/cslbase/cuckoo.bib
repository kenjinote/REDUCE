                 experience of the current developments in LISP and
                 specialized LISP hardware happening in Europe, America
                 and Japan. This research will have major implications
                 for computer algebra and algebra system
                 environments.\par

                 Although LISP, by its extensible nature, has always
                 been an evolving language, unconstrained by standards,
                 the past few years have been amongst the most active.
                 In the field of language work there have been
                 SCHEME-84, Common LISP, Standard LISP 85 and 3-LISP,
                 whilst in hardware there are the continuing development
                 of Symbolics, the arrival of Texas Instruments, several
                 experimental machines in Japan, such as FLATS, Alpha
                 and TAO, and the start of similar projects in
                 Europe.\par

                 How all these factors will affect future developments
                 and implementations of REDUCE, MACSYMA and SCRATCHPAD
                 will also be discussed.",

  abstract =     "The benefits of programming in a functional style are
                 well known. For example, algorithms which are expressed
                 as compositions of functions operating on
                 series/vectors/streams of data elements are much easier
                 to understand and modify than equivalent algorithms
                 expressed as loops. Unfortunately, many programmers
                 hesitate to use series expressions because they are
                 typically implemented very inefficiently-the prime
                 source of inefficiency being the creation of
                 intermediate series objects. A restricted class of
                 series expressions, obviously synchronizable series
                 expressions, is defined which can be evaluated very
                 efficiently because they do not require the creation of
                 any intermediate series objects. A Common Lisp macro
                 package has been implemented which supports obviously
                 synchronizable series expressions. Using this macro
                 package, programmers can obtain the advantages of
                 expressing computations as series expressions without
                 incurring any runtime overhead. Obviously
                 synchronizable series expressions could be
                 straightforwardly supported in any programming

  abstract =     "The Symbolic Programming Environment (SPE), developed
                 by Sun Microsystems, is made up of a collection of
                 programming tools and libraries that implement a
                 powerful programming environment for Common Lisp. The
                 central component of the system is the SPE Lisp editor.
                 It is implemented in the style of Emacs, in that it is
                 built up from a set of character and buffer managing
                 primitives in a way that is user-extensible. Because
                 the system is written completely in Common Lisp, the
                 majority of its functionality is readily portable to
                 any full Common Lisp implementation. Some of interfaces
                 the SPE depends on, such as the debugger, depend on
                 lower level extensions to Common Lisp. But these also
                 have turned out to be quantifiable. The Symbolic
                 Programming Environment is an example of an
                 architecture for future workstation-based productivity
                 tools. Like the Common Lisp system it is built on, the
                 SPE is designed for evolution. Inherent in its
                 structure is the capability for it to extend,
                 transform, and grow in a variety of directions far
                 beyond those initially intended by its developers.",

                 and other syntactic objects in program manipulation and
                 other formal systems where matching and substitution or

                 a powerful link integrating diverse tools in such

                 demonstration application, the information gathered by
                 control flow analysis is used to perform a traditional
                 flow analysis problem, induction variable elimination.
                 Extensions and limitations are discussed. The
                 techniques presented in this paper are backed up by
                 working code. They are applicable not only to Scheme,

                 of the traditional client/server model of computation,
                 allowing clients to extend server interfaces and server
                 writers to hide aspects of distribution, such as
                 caching, from clients; (3) support for automatic commit
                 and abort processing of transactions and automatic
                 crash recovery of atomic data. These capabilities
                 provide programmers with the flexibility to exploit the
                 semantics of an application to enhance its reliability
                 and efficiency. Though the design of Avalon/Common Lisp
                 exploits some of the features of Common Lisp, e.g., its
                 packaging mechanism, all of the constructs are

                 semantic knowledge and relationships among data
                 represented. KB encourages the use of the

                 a set of operators be defined for each concept
                 (object). Inheritance is supported for both data types
                 and for operators. KB has a well-defined programming
                 interface through which a user interface language can
                 be easily developed. The semantics of KB are
                 straightforward and allow a programmer considerable
                 flexibility in developing an application. KB borrows
                 heavily from the Flavors system in syntax and semantics

  abstract =     "Wide distribution of the computer algebra system
                 Mathematica has encouraged numerous programmers,
                 researchers and educators to produce libraries of
                 programs in its special language, for incorporation as
                 'packages' into Mathematica systems. Some authors have
                 found that the Mathematica proprietary computer program
                 has problematical and difficult-to-alter semantics. An
                 initial step in opening up such user-written libraries
                 to re-use is an independent re-implementation of the
                 language via a non-proprietary parser. The author
                 describes a parser written in Common Lisp, a language
                 which is appropriate for three reasons: it is a
                 standard and has wide distribution; it supports
                 numerous useful features including automatic storage
                 allocation and garbage collection, arbitrary-precision
                 integers and tools for lexical scanning of languages;
                 and Lisp is the host language for several algebraic
                 manipulation systems whose subroutines may be of some
                 interest for programmers implementing alternative

                 three products, SENAC, InterCall and IRENA. Each of the
                 three is in the Numerical Algorithms Group (Fortran
                 77). SENAC is a package developed by the Mathematical
                 Software Project at the University of Waikato. SENAC
                 includes a symbolic manipulation interpreter (Sencore),
                 together with high level interfaces to the NAG Fortran
                 Library (Numlink) and NAG Graphics Library (Graflink).
                 The system evolved from an interface, Naglink, between
                 the NAG Library and the symbolic manipulation language
                 Macsyma. The Sensore interpreter is written in Common
                 LISP and belongs to the Macsyma/Maple/Reduce family of
                 languages. It is easy to load user-written files
                 written in Common LISP or in SENAC. InterCall is a
                 Mathematica package that enables its user to
                 interactively call external code, for example from an
                 external numeric library. It allows various default
                 settings to be defined for any arguments that need to
                 be passed to any routine in that code, and initial
                 default settings for all the routines in the IMSL and
                 NAG libraries are included with InterCall in the form
                 of a small defaults-database file. IRENA-an Interface
                 from Reduce to NAG-runs under the Reduce computer
                 algebra system and provides an interactive front end to
                 the NAG Library. It has been designed to make the use
                 of the NAG Library considerably simpler, in a number of
                 ways.",

  abstract =     "This paper presents the 'CL/TB' programming interface
                 for Allegro CL (an implementation of Common Lisp) and
                 the relational database management system TransBase.
                 The interface and its components are presently running
                 on SUN UNIX workstations but can easily be installed on
                 all major UNIX workstations. CL/TB supports data
                 manipulation, data definition, and data control. The
                 database system is called by sending SQL- statements as
                 strings from Allegro CL. Basically, CL/TB offers the
                 prominent services of the underlying TransBase
                 programming interface (TBX). The services are
                 successfully integrated into the functional environment
                 of Lisp and enhanced by many additional features to
                 improve ease of use, programming security, and error
                 support. Thus operating on a database system via CL/TB
                 is easy even for unexperienced users. Furthermore CL/TB
                 is compatible with the relational algebra R-Lisp. The
                 first part of this paper is concerned with aspects of
                 structure, design, implementation, and with performance
                 evaluation. The second part gives a defining
                 description of the interface's functions and is
                 intended to be a user guide.",

                 flexible type system which builds on more than 15 years
                 of experience with object-oriented programming. Most
                 current implementations include a comfortable suite of
                 Lisp support tools including an Emacs lisp editor, an
                 interpreter, an incremental compiler, a debugger, and
                 an inspector which together promote rapid prototyping
                 and design. What else might one want from a system? We
                 argue that static typing yields earlier error
                 detection, greater robustness, and higher efficiency
                 and that greater simplicity and more orthogonality in
                 the language constructs leads to a shorter learning
                 curve and more intuitive programming. These elements
                 can be found in Eiffel and a new object-oriented
                 language, Sather, that we are developing at ICSI.
                 Language simplicity and static typing are not for free,
                 though. Programmers have to pay with loss of
                 polymorphism and flexibility in prototyping. We give a
                 short comparison of CLOS, Eiffel and Sather, addressing
                 both language and environment issues. The different
                 approaches taken by the languages described in this
                 paper have evolved to fulfill different needs. While we
                 have only touched on the essential differences, we hope
                 that this discussion will be helpful in understanding
                 the advantages and disadvantages of each language.",

  abstract =     "The benefits of programming in a functional style are
                 well known. In particular, algorithms that are
                 expressed as compositions of functions operating on
                 sequences/vectors/streams of data elements are easier
                 to understand and modify than equivalent algorithms
                 expressed as loops. Unfortunately, this kind of
                 expression is not used anywhere near as often as it
                 could be, for at least three reasons: (1) most
                 programmers are less familiar with this kind of
                 expression than with loops; (2) most programming
                 languages provide poor support for this kind of
                 expression; and (3) when support is provided, it is
                 seldom efficient. \par In any programming language, the
                 second and third problems can be largely solved by
                 introducing a data type called {\em series}, a
                 comprehensive set of procedures operating on series,
                 and a preprocessor (or compiler extension) that
                 automatically converts most series expressions into
                 efficient loops. A set of restrictions specifies which
                 series expressions can be optimized. If programmers
                 stay within the limits imposed, they are guaranteed of
                 high efficiency at all times. \par A Common Lisp macro
                 package supporting series has been in use for some
                 time. A prototype demonstrates that series can be
                 straightforwardly supported in Pascal.",

                 programming language to help readers understand the
                 array of artificial intelligence concepts presented.
                 After an overview of the field of artificial
                 intelligence, the text presents the fundamentals of
                 LISP, explaining the language's features in more detail
                 than any other AI text. Common Lisp is then used
                 consistently, in both programming exercises and
                 plentiful examples of actual AI code.- Back cover This
                 text is intended to provide an introduction to both AI
                 and LISp for those having a background in computer
                 science and mathematics. -Pref.",

                 language stops short of providing a full and

                 handle control. These capabilities, when incorporated

  abstract =     "Lisp is the world's greatest programming language---or
                 so its proponents think. The structure of Lisp makes it
                 easy to extend the language or even to implement
                 entirely new dialects without starting from scratch.
                 Overall, the evolution of Lisp has been guided more by
                 institutional rivalry, one-upsmanship, and the glee
                 born of technical cleverness that is characteristic of
                 the ``hacker culture'' than by sober assessments of
                 technical requirements. Nevertheless this process has
                 eventually produced both an industrial-strength
                 programming language, messy but powerful, and a
                 technically pure dialect, small but powerful, that is
                 suitable for use by programming-language
                 theoreticians.\par

                 We pick up where McCarthy's paper in the first HOPL
                 conference left off. We trace the development
                 chronologically from the era of the PDP-6, through the
                 heyday of Interlisp and MacLisp, past the ascension and
                 decline of special purpose Lisp machines, to the
                 present era of standardization activities. We then
                 examine the technical evolution of a few representative
                 language features, including both some notable
                 successes and some notable failures, that illuminate
                 design issues that distinguish Lisp from other
                 programming languages. We also discuss the use of Lisp
                 as a laboratory for designing other programming
                 languages. We conclude with some reflections on the
                 forces that have driven the evolution of Lisp.",

                 manufacturing lines. This paper describes such a
                 rule-based simulator for a semiconductor manufacturing
                 line, and the language in which it is written. The
                 simulator is written in a rule-based declarative style
                 that uses a single-rule `template' to move thousands of
                 product tots through various process steps; the rule is
                 customized as needed with data for each step, route,
                 lot, tool, manpower skill, etc. Since line or product
                 changes require only reading new data from a database,
                 without reprogramming, this provides a modeling
                 environment that is simple, flexible, and maintainable.
                 The model is implemented in ECLPS (enhanced Common Lisp
                 production system), also known as a knowledge-based or
                 expert systems language. It handles very large models

  abstract =     "Many users of symbolic algebra systems have felt the
                 need for greater CPU power. Yet few of them have
                 ventured into parallel programming due to the steep
                 learning curve and the unfamiliar programming
                 environment entailed by such an effort. In an attempt
                 to remedy that situation, the parallel library MPI has
                 been integrated into both GCL (GNU Common LISP) and GAP
                 (a general purpose language for mathematical group
                 theory). These implementations are examples that extend
                 bindings of MPI to interactive languages. (MPI already
                 has bindings to the compiled languages C and FORTRAN.)
                 Further, this binding to an interactive language
                 retains the interactive environment during execution.
                 Further, STAR/MPI represents a blueprint for binding
                 MPI to other interactive languages besides GCL and GAP,
                 from which comes the name STAR/MPI, or */MPI. STAR/MPI
                 includes a simple SPMD architecture on top of this MPI
                 binding. An important class of sequential algorithms is
                 described that can be parallelized with little effort
                 using STAR/MPI architecture. Since GAP is
                 representative of systems for discrete mathematics and
                 LISP is the basis for several symbolic algebra systems
                 with strengths in nondiscrete mathematics, it is hoped
                 to gain broad feedback on the issues involved. Although
                 vendor-specific, interactive, parallel languages exist,
                 this appears to be the first attempt at defining a
                 binding of a vendor-independent, portable, parallel
                 library to arbitrary interactive languages.",

                 that it is nonstandard. No other application uses the
                 same language, and programs written in it have to be
                 ported when the user switches to another CAD system.
                 Conversely, a large part of HP PE\slash SolidDesigner
                 is written in Common Lisp. To the developers, this

  abstract =     "If we allow the magnitude and angle of a complex
                 number (expressed in polar form) to range over an
                 interval, it describes a semicircular region, similar
                 to a fan; these regions are what we call complex fans.
                 Complex numbers are a special case of complex fans,
                 where the magnitude and angle are point intervals.
                 Operations (especially addition) with complex numbers
                 in polar form are complicated. What most applications
                 do is to convert them to rectangular form, perform
                 operations, and return the result to polar form.
                 However, if the complex number is a Complex Fan, that
                 transformation increases ambiguity in the result. That
                 is, the resulting Fan is not the smallest Fan that
                 contains all possible results. The need for minimal
                 results took us to develop algorithms to perform the
                 basic arithmetic operations with complex fans, ensuring
                 the result will always be the smallest possible complex
                 fan. We have developed the arithmetic operations of
                 addition, negation, subtraction, product, and division
                 of complex fans. The algorithms presented in this
                 article are written in pseudocode, and the programs in
                 Common Lisp, making use of CLOS (Common Lisp Object
                 System). Translation to any other high-level
                 programming language should be straightforward.",

  abstract =     "Software transactional memory (STM) is a promising
                 approach for coordinating concurrent threads, for which
                 many implementation strategies are currently being
                 researched. Although some first steps exist to ease
                 experimenting with different strategies, this still
                 remains a relatively complex and cumbersome task. The
                 reason is that software transactions require
                 STM-specific {\em dynamic crosscutting adaptations},
                 but this is not accounted for in current STM
                 implementations. This paper presents CSTM, an STM
                 framework based on {\em Context-oriented Programming},
                 in which transactions are modelled as dynamically
                 scoped layer activations. It enables expressing
                 transactional variable accesses as user-defined
                 crosscutting concerns, without requiring invasive
                 changes in the rest of a program. This paper presents a
                 proof-of-concept implementation based on ContextL for
                 Common Lisp, along with example STM strategies and
                 preliminary benchmarks, and introduces some of
                 ContextL's unique features for context-dependent
                 variable accesses.",
