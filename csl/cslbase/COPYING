Note that parts of this code link to the LGPL-protected FOX toolkit, and so
binaries made from it need to adhere to the conditions that that imposes.
There are also some fonts that may be distributed freely provided their
license terms accompany them. The Makefiles (etc) here arrange for that to
happen. Newer versions of CSL link to wxWidgets, which has its own license
which is basically LGPL plus generous extensions.
