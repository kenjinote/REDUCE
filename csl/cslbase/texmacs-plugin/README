        TeXmacs plugin for the CSL version of REDUCE      
        --------------------------------------------

For this to work you need a working REDUCE somewhere, and in the
directory that it lives you should have the files
  executable:      r38 OR both r38.exe and r38.com
  heap image file: r38.img 
  special fonts:   r38.fonts             [a directory]
  help files:      r38.doc               [a directory]

Copy the r38 directory from here to the place where TeXmacs keeps its
plugins. For instance on some systems this will be somewhere
like
     /usr/local/share/TeXmacs/plugins
or
     C:\Program Files\WinTeXmacs\TeXmacs\plugins

On some systems a shell variable $TEXMACS_PATH might indicate where
to look.

Also read the r38/install/README file, which basically says that
you should make a command "r38" avaiable on your standard execution
search path.

If you do not have access rights sufficient to install these files
in the standard glocal location where TeXmacs keeps its plugins
then you can put them in a directory of your own choice such that
the name $TEXMACS_HOME_PATH/plugins refers to them. Ie there will be a 
directory $TEXMACS_HOME_PATH/plugins/r38.

If you do not explicitly set it, TeXmacs will treat $TEXMACS_HOME_PATH
as referring to $HOME/.TeXmacs.

If the plugin is installed and if a command called r38 is available then
whenever TeXmacs starts up it should enable its Reduce interaface. To
activate it use the TeXmacs menu "Insert/Session/r38 (CSL)".

For further information about TeXmacs and for all advice about using
it see the TeXmacs on-line documentation or the web pages at
