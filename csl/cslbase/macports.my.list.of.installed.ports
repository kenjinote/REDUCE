See scripts/macport-setup.sh in the root of the Reduce source tree
for information, valid as of January 2016, about which "ports" you need
to install on a Macintosh in order to build Reduce. Note the fact that
the information there referes back to the script make-static*.sh in this
directory, which builds and installs a special copy of libfontconfig.
