            Adjusted versions of the (free) BaKoMa TeX fonts  

The *.ttf files here are the BaKoMa ones *except* that they have been editited
to make two additions of the charecter encoding tables:
(a) The character that would seem naturally to belong at position
    0xb7 had been places at 0x2219 in the font. I have made a copy of it
    back at 0xb7 in place of the ".notdef" otherwise present in that
    location.
(b) The character at position 0xad is hard to access on X11 and MacOSX
    because that Unicode point is used for SHY, the "Soft Hyphen", and
    default rendering code does not display anything there regardless of
    any data in the font. So I have made a copy of that data at code point
    0xc5 just beyond other relocated glyphs.
(c) The file-names and the font-names have been adjusted from (eg)
    cmr10/cmr10.ttf to csl-cmr10/csl-cmr10.ttf to avoid any possible
    confustion between these and the regular versions on any TeX fonts. 

It is probable that I could have worked around the encoding difficulties by
implementing special custom support for encoding in my applications, and
indeed for 0x2219 that worked happily provided I build everythng in Unicode
mode. But the adjustmenst made here seem to me to be the simplest way around
the problems of 0xad/SHY.

It thus becomes VITAL that these adjusted versions of the TeX fonts are used
and not any unadjusted but otherwise similar ones.

The permissions associated with the fonts, as indicated in the files in
this directory, permit me to make these changes.
