# Quick and dirty hack: generate a Postscript version of a font - the main
# reason for doing this is that a metric (.afm) file gets created at the
# same time and that is what I want!
# Found on http://www.stuermer.ch/blog/convert-otf-to-ttf-font-on-ubuntu.html
# where credit is given to Thomas Maier.
#
# Since this is so short and merely scripts fontforge a bit I feel reasonably
# comfortable including it here...
