If you try to build Reduce on an old release of Linux you are liable to
need to install up to date copies of gcc, autoconf, automake, libtool
and rsync. For gcc you need to find a suitable public repository, but
# for the others the relevant source archives are icnluded here as
a "convenient" package. In the fullness of time there will be even newer
versions of these, and you should perhaps use the very latest releases
where possible, but the copies here have been found adequate for building
Reduce.
