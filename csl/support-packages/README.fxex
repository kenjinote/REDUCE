FXEX is the FOX extension library, and it contains a range of valuable
add-ons. Different components may have been contributed by different
authors, so to find out who to credit you need to read each file individually.

See http://sourceforge.net/projects/foxdesktop.

At present I do not link in the whole library (partly because of
license concerns) but the printing support for FOX that I use is derived
in part from files from within this package.
