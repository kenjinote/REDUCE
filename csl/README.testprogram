                     Configuring in the CSL directory
                     ================================


One of the most common causes of failure when trying to build CSL and Reduce
seems to be not having all the necessary development tools and libraries
installed and available. When things go wrong because of this there will
probably be a message somewhere in a configure or build log that can in
fact point at what has happened, but it is often tedious and non-obvious
to even experienced developers to find that.

So the .../trunk/csl directory contains a mini-project called "testprogram"
such that configuring and building it should be a reasonable sanity check
on your build environment. On Windows it creates a trivial dialog box that
can be closed by clicking the button in it, while on systems that use X it
puts a medium sized window in the middle of your screen and you can close
that using the close button that a window manager will attach to it.

These programs are crude and minimal - so they do not test everything - and
also the configure script that goes with them may report fatal errors in
cases where manual adjustment of resulting Makefiles could coax a full
version of Reduce to build. So please view this as an attempt to be helpful
and check for a collection of things that are expected and not as a carefully
engineered and precise qualification test for your platform!

From the trunk directory you can go
       scripts/csl-sanity-check.sh
which carries out the steps described below.


The explanation here is for the benefit of peopel who wish to run through
the checks manually - presumably because there is some problem for them.

[optionally]    autoreconf -f -i -v    [in trunk/csl]
        This will re-make the various autoconf-related files. You may not
        need to do this, but if you get complaints about automake
        version compatibility this is what you should try. Note that
        the script .../trunk/autogen.sh performs this process in all relevant
        parts of your local tree, so can be useful if autoreconf proves
        necessary here. Indeed I would tend to view the use of the
        autogen.sh script in the trunk directory as preferable since it
        recreates configure-related scripts throughout the REDUCE tree.

./configure [in trunk/csl]
        Some people will quite properly prefer
          cd /tmp; .../reduce-algebra/trunk/csl/configure
        so that the test performed here does not leave any files within the
        main source tree. The top-level mechanisms to run the tests build
        the test stuff in the ...trunk/cslbuild directory. Again this indicates
        that useing scripts/csl-sanity-check is generally a good plan.
        The configure script will take of the order of 30 second to (say)
        ten minutes depending on how fast your computer and which operating
        system it is running. If all goes well the final few lines of output
        should be along the lines of
                configure: creating ./config.status
                config.status: creating Makefile
                config.status: executing depfiles commands
                configure: Build environment seems OK
        If this is not the case and you get a diagnostic I hope it will be
        a clean one asking you to install some particular tool or library.
        Note that for the package management systems that come with many
        operating systems you will need to install the "development" variant
        of support for a package. Eg "ncurses-dev" rather than only "ncurses".

        If the configure script fails but without a clear message asking you
        to install some particular package then you can look at the log
        file "config.log" to try to understand what went wrong, and when you
        have found out please consider updating the configure script (in the
        file "configure.ac") and reporting your proposed updates back to the
        package maintainers. 

make
        Whether you configured in the source tree or in /tmp (or indeed
        anywhere else) a call to "make" should compile a small test
        program called "testprogram". If the compilation fails then you
        will need to debug, update configure.ac to detect that cause of the
        problem cleanly and report back to the Reduce developers.

        Note that if you are not using either cygwin or Linux then it
        might be prudent to check that you use the GNU version of "make"
        rather than any other version, since for the main Reduce build
        you will need that. You can verify that you have GNU make by
        giving the command
                make --version
        and if "make" does not give a brief response identifying itself
        as GNU Make then try "gmake" instead in case the version you need is
        available under that name.

./testprogram
        Finally you can try the program. Under X windows it will fail in a
        messy way if you do not have any 24-point fonts installed, and the
        font it uses to display a message is the first font of that size
        that it comes across (and so will often be ugly). The test program
        is not intended to be clever or pretty - it is just a chance to
        verify that a library can be created and then linked to and that
        the fundamental Windows or X libraries can be used.
