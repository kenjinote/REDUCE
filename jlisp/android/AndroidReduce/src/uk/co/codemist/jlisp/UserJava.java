// This is to demonstrate how user Java code can be called from Jlisp.
// You may edit this file to put in arbitrary Java definitions in the
// various methods (which had better be public static and named as shown 
// here). 
//
// From within Jlisp (and hence REDUCE) the function USERJAVA will then
// call the method from here that corresponds to the relevant number of
// arguments. This class MUST be called "UserJava" but it is loaded
// dynamically when Jlisp is running and when the first use of it is
// attempted. So the class file must be somewhere that the default Java
// classloader will look. But this file does NOT need to be present when
// Jlisp is built.
