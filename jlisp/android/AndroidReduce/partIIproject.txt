sum and product limits
scriptBox width should take into account cover rare cases, when superscript is completely engulfed by the base
measure superscript and subscript shift for all letters

[TODO]
(solved) figure a solution to the raise to the power last group of symbols only problem
(solved) figure a solution to the navigation problem
(solved) add the onTouch functionality
(solved) figure out the undo problem.
(solved) figure out the visual pointer problem
figure out a solution to the blinking problem

[fixes]
"pointer in the middle => enter => undo" problem
(solved) identifiers in reduce should be surrounded with spaces
(solved) shiftable keyboard buttons should be only one at a time
(solved) shift and var should return to normal after one click.
(solved) formulae width should adjust upon screen orientation
Make undo work while the answer is being calculated
(solved) x10 button
(solved) the touch and undo problem
(solved) all pointer movements should not count in undo
(solved) if the user forgets to close a bracket it shouldn't be a problem
Preferences screen should be effective
add the KernalSequence
make it always scroll to the end properly.
(solved) add the copy functionality
refactor all input system constants into one place
rename pointer to cursor
(solved) See why wrapper expressions are jammed at the end when you copy the expression by touching it
(solved) solve the problem with the input not fitting on the screen
make left and right buttons repeat when held down
fix the (enter=>copy=>undo=>undo=>redo=>redo) bug
make sure the app completely remembers its state
(not needed) in copy, maybe a better idea to insert instead of replace
fix the bug with undoing and redoing a superscript
(solved) add a splash screen
allow arbitrary dimensions matrices.
numbers after letters should be subscripts
letters followed by numbers count as a variables (hence should insert *)
