The material included here is work done by Ahmad Akra as an
undergraduate project in 2011-12. He has granted permission for
his code to be made available here under the same (BSD License)
terms as the rest of Jlisp and Reduce. His code uses Jlisp and
Reduce as the basis for an Android algebraic calculator, and as
well as the work porting Jlisp to android and making it support
a touch-screen interface at all a significant part of his efforts
have resulted in layout code for mathematical display and schemes
that try to adapt that for large and small formulae being displayed
on small and large screens.
