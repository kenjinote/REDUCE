The mma module provides a file-based interface to Mathematica's CAD

It automatically checks for executable
/Applications/Mathematica.app/Contents/MacOS/MathKernel or /usr/local/bin/math,
which are the common names for text-based Mathematica on OSX and Linux,
repectively. This can be overridden with an environment variable MATHEMATICA.
Note that at least on OSX, MathKernel must be called with its absolute path.

Windows is not supported.
