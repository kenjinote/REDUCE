Make sure that QEPCAD is working for you from the shell and that the
executable "qepcad" is in the search path of your shell. Note that you
have to setup an environment variable qe for QEPCAD to work.

This Reduce package includes also an interface to the simplifier SLFQ
for large quantifier-free formulas. SLFQ is based on QEPCAD and
distributed on the QEPCAD website. For using this option, make sure that
also the executable "slfq" works from the shell and is in the path of
your shell.
