<H4>Introduction</H4>
<P>The <B>GeoProver</B> (formerly GEOMETRY) is a small package for mechanized 
(plane) geometry manipulations with non degeneracy tracing, available for 
different CAS platforms (Maple, MuPAD, Mathematica, and Reduce).</P>
<P>It provides the casual user with a couple of procedures that allow him/her to 
mechanize his/her own geometry proofs. Version 1.1 grew out from a course of 
lectures for students of computer science on this topic held by the author at 
the Univ. of Leipzig in fall 1996 and was updated after a similar lecture in 
spring 1998. </P>
<P>The (completely revised) version 1.2, finished in March 2002, was set up as a 
generic software project to manage the code for different platforms in a unified 
way. Even most of the function names changed due to more concise naming 
conventions. There is a close relationship to the SymbolicData project (see <A 
href="http://www.symbolicdata.org/">http://www.symbolicdata.org/</A>). </P>
<P>For examples we refer to the SymbolicData GEO table that contains many proof 
schemes of geometry theorems, mainly from Chou's book, and an interface from 
SymbolicData to the GeoProver.</P>
<P>Comments, bug reports, hints, wishes, criticisms etc. are welcome. Please 
send them to the author.</P>

<H4>Acknowledgements</H4>
<P>Malte Witte translated the code of version 1.1 from Reduce to Maple, MuPAD, 
and Mathematica and filled the SymbolicData GEO table with many examples from 
mechanized geometry theorem proving, mainly from Chou's book.</P>
<P>Benjamin Friedrich collected examples and solutions with geometric background 
from IMO contests.</P>
<H4>Upgrade Information</H4>Proof schemes from Version 1.1 require an upgrade. 
There is a perl script <TT>changeFiles.pl</TT> to support this upgrade.
