There are some old files with names like old-geometry.red that represent
an earlier version of this code.

on 16 March 2015 we have:
"geometry.red should be removed since it is a predecessor of geoprover.red.
Best regards, Hans-Gert"

Also note that up to date versions of geoprover (which is supported on
several algebra systems, not just Reduce) can be found at at
