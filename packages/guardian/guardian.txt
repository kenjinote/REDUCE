GUARDIAN:
An experimental REDUCE package for computing with guarded expressions
------------------------------------------------------------------------


This package requires the package REDLOG.

GUARDIAN has originally been described in the following technical report:

Andreas Dolzmann and Thomas Sturm. Guarded expressions in practice.
Technical Report MIP-9702, FMI, Universitaet Passau, D-94030 Passau,
Germany, January 1997.

A revised version of this report has appeared in:

Andreas Dolzmann and Thomas Sturm. Guarded expressions in practice. In
Wolfgang W. Kuechlin, editor, Proceedings of the 1997 International
Symposium on Symbolic and Algebraic Computation (ISSAC 97), pages
376-383, New York, July 1997. ACM, ACM Press.

The file guardian.tex in this directory is essentially the text of MIP-9702.

Switches and Commands:

1. Use the switch "guardian" for turning the GUARDIAN on/off. After
loading the package, it is on. Note that REDLOG procedures cannot be
called with "guardian" on.

2. The "smart mode" is toggled by the switch "gdsmart." It is on by
default.

3. Output mode can be selected using the function "gdomode." Possible
choices:
   a) gdomode matrix;
   b) gdomode gcase;
   c) gdomode gterm;
