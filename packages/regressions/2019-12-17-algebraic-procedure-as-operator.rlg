Comment Do not allow to use the same identifier for an algebraic procedure and an operator,
        and vice versa;


algebraic procedure fn1(x);
    "1";


fn1

algebraic operator fn1;


*** fn1 already defined as algebraic procedure 


fn1 a;


1


get('fn1,'simpfn);


flagp('fn1,'opfn);


t


clear fn1;



algebraic operator fn1;



fn1 a;


fn1(a)


end;
