A case of ugly output when the domain mode is complex rational, 
discovered by Alan Barnes;


on rational, complex;


*** Domain mode rational changed to complex-rational 


% This used to print as
% a + ( - 1) - i

a-1-i;


a - 1 - i
 

% This used to print as 
%
%          1      3
% a + ( - ---) - ---*i
%          2      4
%

a-1/2-3i/4;


     1     3
a - --- - ---*i
     2     4
 

end;
