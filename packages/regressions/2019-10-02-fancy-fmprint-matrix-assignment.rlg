Comment Problem reported on the reduce-algebra-developers mailing list by RenÃ© Grognard:

The input 
 
 a := mat((a11,a12),(a21,a22))

does not produce output in fancy mode. After the next statement, the output is printed.

This tests the fmprint version instead of tmprint.

$


load_package fmprint;




on fancy,fancy_tex;



a := mat((a11,a12),(a21,a22));

\>\left(\begin{array}{cc}a_{11}&a_{12}\\a_{21}&a_{22}\end{array}\right)


x := y;

\>x\,:=\,y


off fancy;


end;
