 simplog didn't completely factor its argument when expandlogs on factor was on;


on factor,expandlogs;

 

off precise;



z := 1-x^2;


z :=  - (x + 1)*(x - 1)


log(z);


log( - (x - 1)) + log(x + 1)


% The following used to return 
%   log( - (x + 1)*(x - 1))

log(1-x^2);


log( - (x - 1)) + log(x + 1)


end;
