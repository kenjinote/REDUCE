Thanks for your interest to our new package!

Files cantens.tst  is still in a draft status.
Some illustrations are still lacking but the main capabilities of 
the package are already displaied. 
Run the test file  both in text mode and in graphic mode (if possible) 
before using the package. The rlg file is the log of the test file run 
in TEXT mode. In graphic mode, the outputs look the same as the ones 
written usually on a sheet of paper. 

The file selfgra.tst and its log file (rlg extension) show how to make 
a non-trivial application of the package.  This application has been 
proposed by Dr. A. Burnel who is an expert in gauge theories.
We think it is a nice illustration of the capabilities of the package.

An almost complete english version of the documentation is available.
