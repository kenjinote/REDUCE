2021-01-05 Raffaele Vitolo <raffaele.vitolo@unisalento.it>
Updated: CDE version 3.0. Main changes are:
* Bug corrected in cde_weaklynl.red
* Linearization of operators in cde_weaklynl improved, this should speed up
calculations.
* Added: a folder examples_weaklynl with some examples of calculations of
Schouten bracket of weakly nonlocal operators. The examples and the software
will be discussed in a forthcoming paper by
M. Casati P. Lorenzoni, D. Valeri, R.V. (2021).
See https://gdeq.org/Weakly_nonlocal_Poisson_brackets for more details.

2020-04-14 Raffaele Vitolo <raffaele.vitolo@unisalento.it>
Updated: CDE version 3.0. Main changes are:
* Added: file cde_weaklynl.red with procedures for the Schouten bracket
of weakly nonlocal C-differential operators, following the algorithm in
Casati, Lorenzoni, Vitolo, Studies in Applied Mathematics, 2020.
* Added: example files for the above procedures.
* Added: in manual.bib: new references for the manual, most of all
the book and the paper in Computer Physics Comm (see below).
* Added: command td(arg,mind) in cde_totalder.red
* Added: command cde_mal in cde_tools.red
* Added: in cde_cdiff.red: definition of super-C-differential operators,
extraction of coefficients of C-differential operators
definition of C-differential operators from a list of coefficients
same for super-C-differential operators
* Added: Nijenhuis bracket in cde_varcalc.red
* Added: definition of super-vector functions (supermap) in cde_superfun.red
* Added: in cde_cdcalc.red: linearization of a supermap
adjoint of a super-C-differential operator.

Updated: package CDE. Main changes are:
* Added: this CHANGELOG.txt file.
* Added: folder 'examples_book' with all examples discussed in the book
by J.S. Krasilshchik, A.M. Verbovetsky, R. Vitolo:
"The symbolic computation of integrability structures for partial
differential equations", Texts and Monographs in Symbolic Computations,
Springer 2018, ISBN: 978-3-319-71655-8. The programs are also available
at the Geometry of Differential Equations website http://gdeq.org
* Added: folder 'examples_compHO' with all examples discussed in the paper
by R. Vitolo 'Computing with Hamiltonian Operators',
Computer Physics Communications Volume 244 (2019), 228-245
ArXiv: https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.03902

2017-10-30 Raffaele Vitolo <raffaele.vitolo@unisalento.it>
* Updated: CDE version 2.1. Main changes are:
1 - New cde_superfunction module, with new syntax to declare superfunctions.
2 - The cde_cdiff module has been cleared of code related with superfunctions.
3 - The cde_cdcalc module is now ready to be extended with operations between
C-Differential operators. It currently covers the linearization of a vector
function and its formal adjoint.
* Fixed: a bug was fixed in a procedure in cde_ansatz.

2016-04-04 Raffaele Vitolo <raffaele.vitolo@unisalento.it>
* Updated: Several small improvements that are not visible at the user.

2015-10-10 Raffaele Vitolo <raffaele.vitolo@unisalento.it>
* Updated:  CDE version 2.0.
* Added: it is possible to compute the linearization of vector
functions, the formal adjoint of differential operators in total derivatives,
Schouten brackets between local Hamiltonian operators, also in multidimensions.

2014-10-10 Raffaele Vitolo <raffaele.vitolo@unisalento.it>
* Added: Version 1.0 of CDE. A new REDUCE package for computations in the
Geometry of PDEs and integrability.
* Capabilities: CDE can compute total derivatives and their restriction on even
or odd partial differential equations, generalized symmetries, conservation
laws, Hamiltonian, symplectic and recursion operators, with local and nonlocal
coordinates.
* License: it is distributed under the same free BSD license of REDUCE.
