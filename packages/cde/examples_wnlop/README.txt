In this folder you can find the example programs that illustrate
the commands provided by the new module cde_weaklynl.red of
the CDE package of the computer algebra system Reduce.
The package is included in the official distribution of Reduce,
see https://reduce-algebra.sourceforge.io/
In order to run the examples, please download Reduce from the above website
and then input one of the example files.
The package provides commands for the calculation of Schouten brackets
of weakly nonlocal operators. This is presented in the paper
M. Casati, P. Lorenzoni, D. Valeri, R. Vitolo
Weakly nonlocal Poisson brackets: tools, examples, computations
(2021)
See https://gdeq.org/Weakly_nonlocal_Poisson_brackets
for details, software and example programs.
