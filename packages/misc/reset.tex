\begin{document}
\maketitle

This package defines a command {\tt RESETREDUCE}
\ttindex{RESETREDUCE} that works through the history of previous
commands, and clears any values which have been assigned, plus any
rules, arrays and the like.  It also sets the various switches to
their initial values.  It is not complete, but does work for most
things that cause a gradual loss of space.
