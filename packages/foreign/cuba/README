This is an interface between Reduce/CSL and the Cuba library for
multi-dimensional numerical integration by a choice of methods.
See http://www.feynarts.de/cuba.

Cuba itself evaluates all integrals over the unit hypercube, but the Reduce
interface provides a small extension, allowing the user to integrate over an 
arbitrary hyper-rectangle.

A more detailed description and installation instructions are in cuba.pdf.


Currently, there are the following issues: 

1. If you run cuba.tst, do it only from Reduce running in a shell window, or
from Reduce running inside Emacs.  The Fox interface or TeXmacs may freeze, for
reasons currently unknown.

2. Make sure your integrand produces a real-valued result over the entire domain
of integration.  Complex values are not handled gracefully.
