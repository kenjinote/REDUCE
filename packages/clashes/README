The intent is that this director will be somewhat temporary. It documents
cases where there are functions with the same name defined in different
parts of Reduce.
The file clash.log is a catalogue. Sometimes one version is a patched or
enhanced version of the other and the improvements need propagating. In
some other cases the issues are purely name-clashes and the functions are
not supposed to be the same.

Every so often some some particular function might be identified and
all its various definitions collected for comparison. As a start I have
done that for "diffp".
