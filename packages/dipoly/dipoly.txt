The following modules comprise a complete distributive polynomial package:

a2dip           Converts a prefix form to distributive polynomial
bcoeff          Base coefficient arithmetic assuming rationals
consel          Constructors and selectors
dip2a           Converts distributive polynomials to distributive form
dipoly          Distributive polynomial arithmetic
dipprint        Distributive polynomial print routines
dipvars         Determines distributive polynomial variables in a form
expvec          Exponent vector arithmetic assuming generic operations
expvec1         Exponent vector arithmetic assuming fast integers


The following other modules are needed to complete the distributive
polynomial package:

farith  (arith) Support for fast arithmetic operators
gcdn    (arith) Numerical gcd routine using binary division
module  (rlisp) Support for "module", "endmodule", etc.
sort    (util)  Sorting routines
where   (rlisp) Support for "where" construct
