INTRODUCTION ==================================================================

jslisp is an experimental version of jlisp which is designed to be compiled
into JavaScript. jlisp is part of the Reduce project which is at 
http://reduce-algebra.sourceforge.net/.


These instructions will in due course be updated to reflect the inclusion of
the files within the Reduce tree. While the code is stabilising here there
really are NO guarantees that it will all even build!

Initial checkin to Sourceforge 18 June 2011. This version has a copy of all the
main Reduce sources within it - in due course those willbde removed in
favour of using the versions in "trunk/packages".


BUILDING INSTRUCTIONS =========================================================

1) Check out the mpreduce_javascript_branch from the MathPiper project repository:
svn checkout http://mathpiper.googlecode.com/svn/branches/mpreduce_javascript_branch mpreducejs

2) Place a copy of ReduceImageInputStream.java into the org.mathpiper.mpreduce package.
Various versions of this file can be found at http://206.21.94.61/misc/ .

3) Obtain a copy of the Google Web Toolkit GWT2.4.0.beta SDK from here:
http://code.google.com/p/google-web-toolkit/downloads/list

4) See lib/google_web_toolkit/compile.sh
for which .jar files to use from GWT2.4.0.beta and where to place them.

5) Execute "ant gwt_dist". A "build" directory will be created and inside of it
will be a directory called "gwt_dist".

6) Change into the build/gwt_dist directory.

7) Execute the compile.sh script with "sh compile.sh".

8) After the application finishes compiling, the CAS can be launched by opening
the build/gwt_dist/war/mpreduce.html file in a browser.

Note: The CAS runs in FireFox, Chrome, IE 9 and Safari. It will also run in
IE 8, but not very well.
