# This file should go into $(HOME)/.astylerc to get the
# default layout that I prefer

# Overall strategy is "horstmann" and that arranges that a close
# brace is always vertically below the corresponding opening brace.

--style=horstmann

# "-L" positions labels indented relative to the block of code they
# relate to.
-L

# "-y" arranges that in "if (a) C; else {..." the "{" is on a separate
# line from the "else".
-y

# "-o" specifies that if the input code had several statement on one line
# this situation is preserved.
-o

# "-c" forces the output to be indented using just spaced never tabs.
-c

# "-m0" helps with indentation of "if" statements where the condition
# is long and splits over several lines.
-m0
