If a single precision real coefficient is found to be equal to an integer
within the precision of the system comparison operation, then it is
normally replaced by the equivalent integer.  If a user does not want this
conversion to occur, the switch {\tt CONVERT} \ttindex{CONVERT} should be
turned off. {\tt CONVERT} is normally on.  However, even with
{\tt CONVERT} off, a real coefficient equal to zero is replaced by 0.
Furthermore, the conversion of a denominator to monic form implies that a
leading real coefficient of 1.0 in a denominator is replaced by 1.
