% The following examples give a confusing error, arising from the fact
% that the current modular factorization code doesn't support
% factorization over non-prime moduli.

setmod 4;
on modular;
f:=(2*x + 3*x)*(x + x);
factorize f;

f:=(2*x + 3*y)*(x + 3*y);
factorize f;

%        1
% ***** --- invalid as (expression mod 4)
%        2

happens, before fctrfkronm is involved.
