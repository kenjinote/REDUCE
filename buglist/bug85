% The following integral appears to run forever with the regular
% integrator, but finishes quickly (although not returned in a closed
% form) if algint is loaded.

ex := (sqrt(k)*sqrt(k**2 + y**2)*k)/(sqrt(c)*sqrt(a*k**2 + a*y**2 -
      sqrt(k**2 + y**2)*k*y - k**3 - k*y**2)*sqrt(2));

% int(ex,y);

load_package algint;

int(ex,y);

end;
