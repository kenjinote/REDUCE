% You do get an answer, but only after much more time than should be needed.

YOU SOLVE EQ1 WITH RESPECT TO CTE

1)THE ANSWER IS GIVEN IN Time: 12040 ms  plus GC time: 1780 ms 
2)YOU TRY A SECOND TIME YOU NEED  Time: 900 ms  
3)YOU TRY A LAST TEST AND YOU WILL NEVER HAVE AN ANSWERD!!!!

  THE PROBLEM IS NOT TO SOLVE 2,3 OR 4 TIMES THE SAME EQUATION
BUT THE PROBLEM IS THAT IF THE SOLVE WAS CALLED IN A PROCEDURE
TO SOLVE A LOT OF EQUATIONS WICH HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH
EQ1 WHEN YOU ARRIVE WHERE YOU MUST SOLVE EQ1 IT IS INTRACTABLE...;

on evallhseqp; 
 
on time; 
 
eq1:=y=(-sqrt(-2*log(x)*a+cte)*b+1)/(x**(3*a*b**2)*sqrt(-2*log(x)*a+cte)); 
 
solve(eq1,cte); 
 
solve(eq1,cte); 
 
solve(eq1,cte); 

%HERE YOU WILL NEVER HAVE AN ANSWER !!!!
%HERE YOU WILL NEVER HAVE AN ANSWER !!!!
%HERE YOU WILL NEVER HAVE AN ANSWER !!!!  

end;
