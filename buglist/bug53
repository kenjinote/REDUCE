num_solve({3*x+4*y-3, 2*x-7*y+11, x-y-1},{x,y});

% ***** numbers of variables and functions don't match

comment

the blurb seems to say

...be given. If not given, random values are taken instead. If the number
of forms is not equal to the number of variables, the Newton method
cannot be applied. Then the minimum of the sum of absolute squares is
located instead.

Ie I think that the manual says you should be able to give more equations
than variables;

end;
